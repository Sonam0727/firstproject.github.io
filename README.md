Data Analytics Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! This repository showcases the projects and skills I have developed in the field of data analytics. Below, you will find details about my completed projects, including descriptions, tools used, and key insights.
Projects
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Date: December 2024 – January 2025
Description: Used the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This classic beginner project involved data exploration, feature engineering, and machine learning model development.
Tools and Techniques:
•	Python for data processing and model building
•	Scikit-learn for machine learning
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Dataset: Titanic dataset containing details like age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.
Key Insights:
•	Engineered features like family size and cabin prefix to improve model accuracy.
•	Achieved a significant accuracy score using logistic regression and decision trees.
2. User Engagement Analysis on an Online Learning Platform
Date: November 2024
Description: Analyzed user behavior to improve student engagement and course completion rates. Conducted a comprehensive case study and provided actionable recommendations.
Tools and Techniques:
•	Python for data exploration, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Key Insights:
•	Highlighted engagement patterns to optimize platform features.
•	Suggested strategies to boost course completion rates.
